# Week 2 - Assignment 2

Coach: [Yiqi Yan](https://saoyan.github.io/)  

***
Apil 28, 2018: releasing the reference code of Assignment 2   
Please refer to [this script](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp03_SoftmaxRegression_mnist.py)

***

## Goals  
* Review what we talked about in tutorial
  * Basis of Tensorflow. You may find [this script](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp01_basic_usage.py) useful.
  * Implementing Linear Regression with Tensorflow. You may find [this script](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp02_simple_linear_model.py) useful.
* Time to finish your own project: Implement a softmax regression model for MNIST classification task.  
[*SoftmaxRegression_mnist.py*](https://github.com/TFTxiaozu/TFT-ML-Week-2/blob/master/Assignment-2/SoftmaxRegression_mnist.py) contains part of the code. You need to finish this script and run it one your own computer. If your implementation is correct, the accuracy will reaches 90% after about 1000 steps of training.

**Attention**  
Remember to download [data](https://github.com/TFTxiaozu/TFT-ML-Week-2/tree/master/Assignment-2/data) and place this folder at the same path as *SoftmaxRegression_mnist.py*.
