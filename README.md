# TFT-ML-Week-2

## Assignment 1  
[Materials](https://github.com/TFTxiaozu/TFT-ML-Week-2/tree/master/Assignment-1)  

* Implement Linear Regression from scratch. (The key is to understand gradient descent.)
* Get familiar with Tensorflow.

## Assignment 2
[Materials](https://github.com/TFTxiaozu/TFT-ML-Week-2/tree/master/Assignment-2)  

* Review what we talked about in tutorial
  * Basis of Tensorflow. You may find [this script](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp01_basic_usage.py) useful.
  * Implementing Linear Regression with Tensorflow. You may find [this script](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp02_simple_linear_model.py) useful.
* Implement a softmax regression model for MNIST classification task.
