# TFT-ML-Week-2

## Get prepared  
Get started with Tensorflow!  
* [Here are some simple demos.](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow) Play with [*exp_1*](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp01_basic_usage.py) and [*exp_2*](https://github.com/SaoYan/LearningTensorflow/blob/master/exp02_simple_linear_model.py) and try to understand as much as you can.  
* There are some tutorials (in Chinese) to help you understand the code. For *exp_1*, refer to [section 2](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxOTQ3MTI5NQ==&mid=100000348&idx=1&sn=b71d4ce18a8fe6bb7962f161cb186107&scene=19#wechat_redirect). For *exp_2*, refer to [section 3](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxOTQ3MTI5NQ==&mid=100000351&idx=1&sn=20491f00e2bd5b49dfb7e9b03c99dcf0&scene=19#wechat_redirect).
